roman-amphitheaters
===================
Edited by Sebastian Heath.

A re-usable list of Roman Amphitheaters. The primary version is the geojson file, which can be rendered as a map by a variety of tools. Other available files are derived from the geojson.

The data is likely incomplete as, depending on how you define the term, there are over amphitheaters known from the Roman world, with more being discovered.

Wikipedia's list of Roman amphitheaters at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_amphitheatres was an early source for the early versions of this list. I used that as a starting point but have made many corrections. Tom Elliot added data from the Pleiades Project. In summer 2015, D. Bennett added orientation and other data. The full history of edits and contributions are available in the history of this github repository.
